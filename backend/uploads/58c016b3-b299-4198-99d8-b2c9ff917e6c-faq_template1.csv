How long does it take your office to file the forms?,"If we have all the documents from you, we strive to file within 10-14 business days. However, much will depend on how ready the client is and if we need any additional documentation."

When do I need to get an immigration medical exam? How do I get it? How much is it?,"To avoid delays, you should send your medical exam at the time of filing your application. Alternatively, you can wait for USCIS to request it later on, in the form of a request for evidence. You can find a doctor here; cost will vary."
